### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in process system engineering at Purdue University. My current research focuses on mixed-integer optimization and its applications in chemical, process, and energy systems engineering.

- ðŸ”­ I'm also a developer of the mixed-integer solver [MindtPy](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/mindtpy.html).
